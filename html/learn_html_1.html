    <blockquote cited="www.google.com"> A paragraph is a series of sentences that are connected by transition words or
        phrases.</blockquote> It is used to convey a coherent idea or a narrative to a reader. A good paragraph should
    have a clear thesis statement, which should be supported by the sentences that follow. The sentences in a paragraph
    should also be related to each other in terms of their content and flow smoothly from one to the other without
    interrupting the thought. Additionally, a good paragraph should be concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary
    repetition or long-winded explanations.
